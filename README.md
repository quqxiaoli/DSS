# Distributed Cache System

A production-ready distributed caching system built from scratch in Go, designed to handle high concurrency, scalability, and fault tolerance. This project implements a key-value store with advanced features such as consistent hashing, LRU eviction, TTL, node failure detection, and observability, making it suitable for real-world applications like API rate limiting.

Developed over 21 days (March 4â€“24, 2025) as part of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with additional high-level features, this project showcases strong engineering practices and problem-solving skills for campus recruitment at top-tier companies.
